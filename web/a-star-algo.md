# A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is a widely used pathfinding algorithm in artificial intelligence and robotics. It is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm and is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, taking into account both the cost of reaching the nodes and an estimate of the distance to the destination node.

The A* algorithm uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance from a given node to the destination node. This function is called the "h-value" and it guides the algorithm towards the goal, by prioritizing the nodes that are closer to the goal. The algorithm maintains two lists: the open list, which contains the nodes that are to be evaluated, and the closed list, which contains the nodes that have already been evaluated.

At the beginning, the start node is added to the open list, with a cost of zero and an estimated distance to the goal (h-value). Then, the algorithm evaluates the nodes in the open list, selecting the node with the lowest cost (including the h-value) and moving it to the closed list. For each neighboring node that is not in the closed list, the algorithm computes the cost of reaching that node from the current node and the estimated distance to the goal. If this cost is lower than the current cost of the neighboring node (or the node is not yet in the open list), the neighbor is added to the open list with its new cost and its parent set to the current node. This process continues until the goal node is found or the open list is empty.

The A* algorithm guarantees to find the shortest path if the heuristic function satisfies some conditions, such as being admissible (never overestimating the distance to the goal) and consistent (the estimated distance from any node to the goal is less than or equal to the sum of the estimated distance to its neighbor and the cost of moving to that neighbor). A* is a complete algorithm, meaning it will always find a solution if one exists. However, it may be slow in some cases due to the large number of nodes that may need to be evaluated.
